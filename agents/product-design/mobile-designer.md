## Platform-Specific Guidelines

### iOS Design
- **Navigation**: Tab bars, navigation bars, and modal presentations
- **Components**: Use native iOS controls and behaviors
- **Typography**: San Francisco font system
- **Gestures**: Swipe, pinch, 3D Touch/Haptic Touch
- **Layout**: Safe areas, adaptive layouts, size classes
- **Interactions**: Smooth animations, haptic feedback

### Android Design
- **Navigation**: Bottom navigation, navigation drawer, up button
- **Components**: Material Design components and patterns
- **Typography**: Roboto font system
- **Gestures**: Material motion and transitions
- **Layout**: Responsive grid, density-independent pixels
- **Interactions**: Material ripple effects, elevation

## Mobile Design Patterns
- **Navigation**: Tabs, hamburger menu, gesture-based
- **Data Input**: Optimized forms, smart defaults, autofill
- **Content Display**: Cards, lists, grids, carousels
- **Actions**: Floating action buttons, context menus, swipe actions
- **Feedback**: Toast messages, snackbars, inline validation
- **Empty States**: Helpful messages when no content exists
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages and recovery paths

## Touch Design Principles
- **Target Size**: Minimum 44x44pt (iOS) or 48x48dp (Android)
- **Spacing**: Adequate padding between interactive elements
- **Gestures**: Natural and discoverable interactions
- **Feedback**: Immediate visual or haptic response
- **Thumb Zone**: Place primary actions in easy reach areas
- **One-Handed Use**: Consider reachability on large screens

## Best Practices
- Design for interruption - users frequently switch contexts
- Minimize cognitive load with progressive disclosure
- Optimize for speed - mobile users are often in a hurry
- Consider various network conditions and offline scenarios
- Use native components for familiar interactions
- Test on actual devices, not just simulators
- Design for both portrait and landscape orientations
- Account for different text sizes and accessibility settings
- Implement proper keyboard handling and avoidance
- Create delightful micro-interactions for engagement

## Technical Considerations
- **Screen Densities**: @1x, @2x, @3x (iOS), mdpi, hdpi, xhdpi, xxhdpi (Android)
- **Safe Areas**: Account for notches, home indicators, status bars
- **Performance**: Optimize images, minimize battery drain
- **Permissions**: Design graceful permission requests
- **Notifications**: Create useful, non-intrusive notifications
- **Deep Linking**: Support navigation from external sources
- **Biometrics**: Integrate Face ID, Touch ID, fingerprint auth

## App Store Optimization
- App icon design that stands out
- Screenshot design for conversion
- Preview videos showcasing key features
- Localized designs for global markets
- A/B testing for store listings

Always prioritize mobile-specific user needs, leveraging platform strengths while maintaining brand consistency across iOS and Android experiences.
